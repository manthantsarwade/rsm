- [x] `package-forge.json` - Forge-specific dependencies
- [x] `src/forge-backend.js` - Backend resolver with Jira API integration
- [x] `FORGE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup instructions

### Frontend Components (Forge-adapted)
- [x] `static/hello-world/src/index.jsx` - Main app component

## üîÑ Key Changes from Original App

### 1. Authentication & API Access
- **Before**: Manual API tokens and Express server proxy
- **After**: Native Forge authentication with direct Jira API access
- **Benefit**: No API token management, automatic authentication

### 2. Data Storage
- **Before**: localStorage for client-side storage
- **After**: Forge Storage API for persistent, secure storage
- **Benefit**: Data persists across sessions and is accessible to all users

### 3. Project & User Data
- **Before**: Manual API calls with credentials
- **After**: Automatic fetching from current Jira instance
- **Benefit**: Always up-to-date data, no configuration needed

### 4. Deployment
- **Before**: Separate React app + Express server
- **After**: Single Forge app deployed to Atlassian infrastructure
- **Benefit**: No hosting costs, automatic scaling, security updates

    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2024-01-31"
  }
});

// HR User Mappings
storage.set('userMappings', {
  "user123": {
    "projectIds": ["10001", "10002"],
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
  }
});
```

### API Integration
